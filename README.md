## üóÉÔ∏è Data Schema

The dataset is divided into four CSV files representing normalized relational tables:

| Table Name        | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `orders`          | Order IDs with date and time of purchase         |
| `order_details`   | order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, quantity |
| `pizzas`          | Pizza ID, type, size, and price information      |
| `pizza_types`     | Name, category, and ingredients of each pizza type |

> All data was imported and structured in a MySQL database. Joins and constraints were handled programmatically.
